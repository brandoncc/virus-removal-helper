### virus-removal-helper

#### Overview
I originally wrote this application using [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/).  It needed to be updated so I decided
to rewrite it in Ruby, as the code would be much more manageable and easier to maintain.  Also, Ruby is a joy to write.

#### What is it?
I have a computer repair business, so I am constantly downloading and using anti-virus and anti-spyware applications.  I
decided in 2008 that I was tired of doing this process manually all the time.  Thus, VHC was born.  I cannot remember
what I originally intended it to stand for though, so this iteration is VRT (Virus Removal Helper).

VRT allows users to easily download, install, run and optionally remove many popular anti-virus and anti-spyware
applications.  The list is always growing, if there is an application that should be in here, but isn't please open an
issue and request it.

#### Todo
- Finish the application (it is not ready yet)
- Add pictures to readme
